Since 2011, over 1,500 companies have trusted [HireFire] to autoscale more than 5,000 applications hosted on [Heroku], managing over 10,000 web and worker dynos.

HireFire is distinguished by its support for both web and worker dynos, extending autoscaling capabilities to Standard-tier dynos. It provides fine-grained control over scaling behavior and improves scaling accuracy by monitoring more reliable metrics at the application level. These metrics include request queue time (web), job queue latency (worker), and job queue size (worker), which contribute to making more effective scaling decisions.
